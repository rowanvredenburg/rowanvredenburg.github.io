<p class="text-left">This is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral">Ulam Spiral</a>, created with Java. Each pixel represents one number of a spiralling number line, white pixels are prime numbers and black pixels are not.</p>

<p class="text-left">This distorted moon was generated using a pixel sorting algorithm. The algorithm selects a random line of pixels on the image with a random length (within a range), sorts the pixels from brightest to darkest, then replaces the line of pixels with the sorted line.</p>

<p class="text-left">This is the beginning of the ever expanding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recam%C3%A1n%27s_sequence">Recam√°n‚Äôs sequence</a>. The sequence is somewhat difficult to explain shortly but basically involves jumping back and forth on a number line; these jumps are visualized as the ‚Äúarcs‚Äù in the image.</p>
