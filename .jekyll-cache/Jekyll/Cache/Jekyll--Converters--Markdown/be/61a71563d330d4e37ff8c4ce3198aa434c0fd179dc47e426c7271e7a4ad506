I"-<p>Hi! My name is Rowan Vredenburg and I am a fourth-year Materials Science and Engineering student at the University of Toronto. I have always had an interest for coding and recently became interested in 3D design.</p>

<p>The idea behind this website was as a place to store and share my work in both Blender and procedural math programming.</p>

<p>I am interested in freelance 3D design work to add to my resume and test my skills! Iâ€™m also always welcome to critique, no great artist goes without it (see my <a href="/contact/">contact page</a>)</p>
