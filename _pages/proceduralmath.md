This is an [Ulam Spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral), created with Java. Each pixel represents one number of a spiralling number line, white pixels are prime numbers and black pixels are not.

This distorted moon was generated using a pixel sorting algorithm. The algorithm selects a random line of pixels on the image with a random length (within a range), sorts the pixels from brightest to darkest, then replaces the line of pixels with the sorted line.

This is the beginning of the ever expanding [Recamán's sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recam%C3%A1n%27s_sequence). The sequence is somewhat difficult to explain shortly but basically involves jumping back and forth on a number line; these jumps are visualized as the “arcs” in the image.
