Hi! My name is Rowan Vredenburg and I am a graduate of the University of Toronto Materials Science and Engineering program, currently working in engineering project management. I have always had an interest for coding and recently became interested in 3D design.

The idea behind this website was as a place to store and share my work in both Blender and procedural math programming.

I am interested in freelance 3D design work to add to my resume and test my skills! I'm also always welcome to critique, no great artist goes without it (see my [contact page](/contact/))
