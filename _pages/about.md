I am a fourth-year Materials Science and Engineering student at the University of Toronto. I have always had an interest for coding and recently became interested in 3D design.

I created this website as a place to store and share my work in both Blender and procedural math programming.

I am interested in freelance 3D design work to add to my resume and test my skills!
