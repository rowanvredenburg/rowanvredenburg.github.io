Hi! My name is Rowan Vredenburg and I am a fourth-year Materials Science and Engineering student at the University of Toronto. I have always had an interest for coding and recently became interested in 3D design.

The idea behind this website was as a place to store and share my work in both Blender and procedural math programming.

I am interested in freelance 3D design work to add to my resume and test my skills! I'm also always welcome to critique, no great artist goes without it (see my [contact page](/contact/))
